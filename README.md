The objective of this paper was to development of an ML algorithm which will reduce factors like incremental delay, vehicle operation cost, fuel operating, and cost emission by suggesting the shortest possible route for drivers.

Philadelphia has more traffic compared to other three cities. It also analyses rush hours in all three cities from 8 in the morning to 5 in the evening but for Philadelphia from 8 in the morning to 12 midnight.

Moreover, due to heavy traffic the stoppage time from 15 to 17 hours during the evening has significantly risen in all cities. 

The entry and exit heading in this paper have been encoded into numbers so that the model can use encoding for the prediction. Thus, the model predicted the entry heading before the business junction point where driver can easily go to avoid the intersection where traffic is jammed.
